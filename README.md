# Image Warping onto Cylindrical Projection

This C++ program uses OpenCV to warp an input image onto a cylindrical projection. The `BendImage` class provides methods for projecting a 2D image onto a cylindrical surface, considering the distortion due to the cylindrical shape.

## Requirements

- OpenCV

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Compile the C++ program:


3. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./bendImage
    ```

4. The program will load an example image, warp it onto a cylindrical projection, and display the result.
